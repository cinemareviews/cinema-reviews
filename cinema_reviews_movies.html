            <p>Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is the fresh addition to Marvel’s Cinematic Universe. With a mostly Asian cast, Shang-Chi delivers a great superhero origin story with fluid fight scenes and special effects. The movie set ups the new phase in this vast cinematic universe, and it seems it will not disappoint.

            </div>
            <p>The movie introduces you to the dumbest and most dysfunctional team combo, and spoiler: it actually works out perfectly. DC’s The Suicide Squad follows up to Suicide Squad from 2016, same formula, just better execution. The characters’ chemistry and interactions really make the movie better than it is.
Fair warning, the movie can get pretty violent.</p>

              </div>
            <p>Starring Ryan Reynolds, Free Guy was well received by the public with an interesting and exciting story backed up with great special effects. The concept reminds people of “The Truman Show” due to it being self-aware and comedic.  Free Guy is an overall fun and entertaining movie, it is definitely not your piece of cake if you don’t like movies that overflow with comedy.</p>

            </div>
            <p>A Disney live-action remake of the classic fairy tale: Cinderella. Even with musical numbers and magical effects in many scenes, people still found it disappointing due to the lack of overall substance and originality. The public expected something “darker”, rather than the same story from the first Disney adaptation in 1950.</p>
