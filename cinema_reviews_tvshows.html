          <p>Squid Game takes child games and turns them into gruesome and deadly competition. Its fast-moving plot and meaningful interactions between the cast really make it one of the best Korean thriller shows of the year. Beware though, Squid Game contains graphic depictions of violence that may not be suitable if you have a weak stomach or heart.
It is currently dominating Netflix’s trending page everywhere, so don’t stay behind.</p>

          <p>This comedy series revolves around the most invested characters which are three absolute strangers. Funny thing is, they all share a passion for true crime. A murder happens in their building, and lucky for them (sorry, victim), they have the requirements to solve it, or at least try to.
For the most part, it’s guaranteed you’ll be laughing.</p>

          <p>The show revolves around the most socially awkward main character you’ll ever meet, Otis. It explores all of the situations and experiences that revolve around sex education and being a teenager, what a shacker. This comedy follows up his guidance and how he will go through high school whilst learning. The amount of people saying how relatable this show is was the secret to its success; maybe you’ll like it too if you’re around the characters’ age.</p>
